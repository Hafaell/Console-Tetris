+ Piece rotation.
+ Score and high score system.
+ Real-time or turn-based game mode.
+ Next piece that is goint to be draw.

## About UI

Furthermore, I decided to make a simple interface where if you want, you can modify the position where each part of the game is going to be draw.

If you want to draw the screen your way, just modify the values in UI script to draw the desired size or position.


## About Vector2

In case you are in doubt about Vector2 they are just a class used for store any two values. Doesn't necessarily have to be X and Y positions
